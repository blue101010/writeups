# Challenge snek

There's a snake in my boot! (100)

Beginner Made by CDA Alumni
A classic game of Snake, but the developer left the winning flag in the binary a little too exposed.

```bash
└─$ strings snek | grep level
leveleffect{sn4k3_1n_th3_t411_gr455}
Too many levels of symbolic links
```

## flag

```bash
leveleffect{sn4k3_1n_th3_t411_gr455}
```
