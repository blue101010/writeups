I hope this message reaches you in good stead amidst the chaos of The Fray. I write to you with an offer of alliance and resistance against the oppressive regime of KORPâ¢.

It has come to my attention that KORPâ¢, under the guise of facilitating The Fray, seeks to maintain its stranglehold over our society. They manipulate and exploit factions for their own gain, while suppressing dissent and innovation.

But we refuse to be pawns in their game any longer. We are assembling a coalition of like-minded factions, united in our desire to challenge KORPâ¢'s dominance and usher in a new era of freedom and equality.

Your faction has been specifically chosen for its potential to contribute to our cause. Together, we possess the skills, resources, and determination to defy KORPâ¢'s tyranny and emerge victorious.

Join us in solidarity against our common oppressor. Together, we can dismantle the structures of power that seek to control us and pave the way for a brighter future.

Reply to this message if you share our vision and are willing to take a stand against KORPâ¢. Together, we will be unstoppable. Please find our online form attached.

In solidarity,
